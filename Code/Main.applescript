--  MacYTDL
--  A GUI for the Python Script youtube-dl (http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/).  Many thanks to Shane Stanley, Adam Albrec, kopurando and Michael Page
--  Trying to bring in useful functions in a pithy GUI with few AppleScript extensions and without AppleScriptObjC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Include libraries - needed for Shane Staney's Dialog Toolkit
use AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later
use scripting additions
use script "DialogToolkitMacYTDL" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later
property parent : AppleScript

-- Set variables and default values
