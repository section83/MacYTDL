--  A GUI for the Python Scripts youtube-dl and yt-dlp.  Many thanks to Shane Stanley, Adam Albrec, kopurando and Michael Page
--  This is the Download Monitor
--  This script provides a download Monitor for each video file download requested by user - it is called by main.scpt

use AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later
use scripting additions
use script "DialogToolkitMacYTDL" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later

-- Run the Monitor when the script is called
