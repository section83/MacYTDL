# MacYTDL

**APOLOGIES – MacYTDL is barely functional in macOS Tahoe. It spends long amounts of time with the spinning wheel of death. Don't know how long this will take to fix.**

MacYTDL is a utility which downloads videos using the [_youtube-dl_](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [_yt-dlp_](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) video downloader scripts. _youtube-dl_ and _yt-dlp_ are able to download videos from a great many web sites. MacYTDL runs on any Apple Mac with macOS 10.10 or later. MacYTDL has been developed mostly in AppleScript. The code is not accessable from within the applet. However, text exports of the code are in the "Code" folder above and can be opened in _Script Editor_. MacYTDL is code signed and notarized. Code signing ensures that the app has not been altered after it has been signed by the developer. Notarized apps have been scanned by Apple for known malware.

### Requirements

An Apple Mac running macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher is required to use MacYTDL. MacYTDL works in Parallels virtual machines.

_yt-dlp_ is the default for all Macs. Python 3.13 is supplied with the _yt-dlp_ executable. However, Homebrew and MacPorts installs can be used. Detail is in the [Help](https://github.com/section83/MacYTDL/blob/master/Help.pdf).

_youtube-dl_ can be used with all versions of macOS up to Monterey 12.2.1. However _youtube-dl_ has not been updated since December 2021 and so is out-of-date. Users on Macs running macOS 10.15 to 12.2.1 can switch between _youtube-dl_ and _yt-dlp_.

### How to install for the first time

* Download and open [the DMG file](https://github.com/section83/MacYTDL/releases/download/1.29.2/MacYTDL-v1.29.2.dmg).
* Click and drag MacYTDL to any location - it's best to use the Applications folder.
* Open MacYTDL.
* When asked, click on "Yes" to install various components and create a preferences folder.
* Provide administrator credentials when asked.
* Wait – it can take time to download and install _yt-dlp_ and _FFmpeg_.
* MacYTDL main dialog is displayed.

### How to update

* Download and open [the DMG file](https://github.com/section83/MacYTDL/releases/download/1.29.2/MacYTDL-v1.29.2.dmg).

* Open MacYTDL. Components such as the preferences file are updated as required.
* There is a facility to download an update, if more recent, in "Utilities".

More detail is available in [the Help file](https://github.com/section83/MacYTDL/blob/master/Help.pdf) (4.9MB).

### Acknowledgements

MacYTDL would be useless without [_yt-dlp_](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). It is a remarkable, feature rich tool maintained by the most dedicated group of volunteers.

Much is owed to Shane Stanley, for his many contributions solving problems with MacYTDL. Shane developed [Dialog Toolkit Plus and Myriad Tables Lib](https://latenightsw.com/support/freeware/) which provide the dialogs in MacYTDL. MacYTDL is developed in [_Script Debugger_](https://latenightsw.com). Many thanks to Mark Alldritt and Shane for their 30 years of dedication to _SD_ and the _SD_ users. _SD_ will be sorely missed.
