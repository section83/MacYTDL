# MacYTDL

MacYTDL is a utility which downloads videos using the [_youtube-dl_](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [_YT-DLP_](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) video downloader scripts. _youtube-dl_ and _YT-DLP_ are able to download videos from a great many web sites. MacYTDL runs on any Apple Mac with macOS 10.10 or later. MacYTDL has been developed mostly in AppleScript. The code is not accessable from within the applet. However, text exports of the code are in the "Code" folder above and can be opened in _Script Editor_. MacYTDL is code signed and notarized.

### Acknowledgements

MacYTDL would be useless without [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) and [_YT-DLP_](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). They are remarkable, feature rich tools maintained by the most dedicated group of volunteers. It should be noted that there has not been a stable release of [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) since December 2021. [_YT-DLP_](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), however, is in active development.

Much is owed to Shane Stanley, for his many contributions solving problems with MacYTDL. Shane developed [Dialog Toolkit Plus and Myriad Tables Lib](https://latenightsw.com/support/freeware/) which provide the dialogs in MacYTDL. Ideas for this GUI front-end came from many sources including:
